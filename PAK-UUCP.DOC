Special keywords within inbound Packet messages:
    DECAP       If the keyword "decap" is found on its own line
                anywhere in the inbound packet message, the message
                is scanned and all characters are set to lowercase
                except for those following a . ? or !.  All of the
                references to self (the originator I, I'll, I've and
                I'm) are kept as uppercase.  The code will do its
                best to reformat yet, in some cases some characers
                which should normally be uppercase in a message is
                left as lowercase.

Packet Message text exclusions:
    If the Packet User includes any "From:" address lines in his or her
    message, they will all be removed.  This is because the Internet
    system will include them as needed.
